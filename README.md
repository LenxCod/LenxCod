- 👋 Hi, I’m @LenxCod, a 22-years old italian guy, starting with his programming journey.
- 👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence and robotics, which are the main fields that I'd like to deepen!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning every programming language, from the main to secondary ones.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any possible project, due to the fact that I have to learn (and I'm willing to :) )
- 📫 How to reach me: contacting me via GitHub for more informations!
- 😄 Pronouns: No ones, call me Lenx :)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't know, I'm coding every-day, tell me :/
